Running EPP Test Server/Client with TCP/TLS as Transport
========================================================

0. Requirements:

   o JDK 1.2.2_06 or later 

   o JSSE 1.0.2

     JSSE 1.0.2 can be downloaded from:

         http://www.javasoft.com/products/jsse/index.html

     Note: JDK 1.3 will not work correctly with JSSE 1.0.2.

   o Apache Xerces Java Parser 1.4.2 or later

     Xerces 1.4.2 can be downloaded from:

         http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/

1. Install JSSE jar files:

        Copy the following files to:

                jcert.jar
                jnet.jar
                jsse.jar

        To
                ${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext

   where JAVA_HOME is the directory where the JDK is installed.

2. Edit java.security file

        Edit file:

                ${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/security/java.security

        to add SunJSSE provider. Add a line "security.provider.2..." like:

                security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
                security.provider.2=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider

3. The testkeys.server.prop file contains the properties for test private keys
   and public certicates for running the EPP Test Server with TCP/TLS as the
   transport. It must reside in the same directory where the test server is
   running with the following files:

         testkeys.server.prop     - EPP Server SSL Property File
         testkeys.server.keystore - EPP Server private/public key store
         testkeys.server.trustore - EPP Server trust store (client public keys)

4. The testkeys.client.prop file contains the properties for test private keys
   and public certicates for running the EPP Test Client with TCP/TLS as the
   transport. It must reside in the same directory where the test client is
   running with the following files:

         testkeys.client.prop     - EPP Client SSL Property File
         testkeys.client.keystore - EPP Client private/public key store
         testkeys.client.trustore - EPP Client trust store (server public keys)

5. The EPP .xsd files must reside in the same directory where the test server
   and client are running.

6. Make sure the EPP API jar file, epp.jar, and Xerces 1.4.2 jar file,
   xercers.jar, are included in the CLASSPATH environment variable.

7. Start the test server

        java EppTestServerTcp port [tls.prop]

   where port is the port number to which the test server is listening,
   and tls.prop is optional for indicating if TLS is used for transport layer
   security and points to the file of EPP Server SSL Property file.
   For example:

        java EppTestServerTcp 10288 testkeys.server.prop

   If you want to start the server without TLS, the command would be:

        java EppTestServerTcp 10288

   To make the test server return XML messages that can be parsed by other
   RTKs, such as Tucows', that expect fully specified namespace prefixes, add
   -Dcom.neulevel.epp.core.EppUtil.fullNamespace run-time option, for
   example:

        java -Dcom.neulevel.epp.core.EppUtil.fullNamespace EppTestServerTcp 10288

8. After the test server is started, i.e. after the message like

        Server started with...

   showed up, start the test client:

        java EppTestClient tcp[-tls] hostname port

   where hostname is the name of the host on which the test server is running,
   and port is the port number on the server to which the client is connected.
   The transport could be tcp, for using TCP with TLS, or tcp-tls, for using
   TCP without TLS.

   If both the client and server are running on the same machine, the hostname
   can be specified as "localhost". For example:

        java EppTestClient tcp localhost 10288

   If the server does not require TLS, the command would be:

	java EppTestClient tcp-tls localhost 10288

   To make the test client send XML messages that can be parsed by other
   RTKs, such as Tucows', that expect fully specified namespace prefixes, add
   -Dcom.neulevel.epp.core.EppUtil.fullNamespace run-time option, for
   example:

        java -Dcom.neulevel.epp.core.EppUtil.fullNamespace EppTestClient ...
